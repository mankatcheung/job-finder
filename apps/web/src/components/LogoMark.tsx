 * lifts to blue-400 because blue-700 on `gray-900` sits too close to its own
 * background to read. Written as a literal so Tailwind's scanner emits both

/**
 * Trakwyn's mark: two chevrons, the leading one solid and the trailing one a
 * hairline of the same shape — a position and the position it came from, which
 * is what the board tracks.
 *
 * The weights are deliberately unequal. Two chevrons at the same weight read as
 * a media control ("fast forward"); a thing and its shadow do not, and the
 * difference survives being shrunk.
 *
 * The square assets (favicon, app icon, extension) are white on the blue tile
 * and so have no theme to follow — this is the only place the mark changes
 * colour.
