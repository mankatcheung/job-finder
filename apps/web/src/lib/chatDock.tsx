/**
 * Global UI state for the desktop chat dock (JEF-133) — which conversations
 * are pinned to the footer and which one (if any) is currently shown as the
 * floating widget. Deliberately holds only ids, not conversation data:
 * titles/messages stay in TanStack Query's cache (`conversationsQueryOptions`
 * / `chatHistoryQueryOptions`), looked up by id wherever they're rendered, so
 * this state can't drift out of sync with the real data.
 *
 * v1 is in-memory only (no localStorage/sessionStorage persistence) — a page
 * reload loses the pinned/expanded state, which is fine since the underlying
 * conversations are safely persisted server-side regardless; reopening one
 * via /assistant/history is a one-click fallback.
